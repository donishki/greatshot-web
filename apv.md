For [APV course project assigment](http://odinuv.cz/course/#project-assignment) 
I have chosen to add features to this project
 that were taught in the course, but I haven't used them:
- paginate result list
- input client and server side validation
- user login, authorization - user and role models
    - registration, login
    - assigning roles to users
- database tables with relations:
    - display data from app.Libtech3 models - app/Libtech3.py
    - Player model
        - got nickname, nationality
        - can has links to sites like twitch, youtube
    - M-N relation of Player and app.Libtech3.Demo
        - user interface for assigning Player to Demo
- error logging
