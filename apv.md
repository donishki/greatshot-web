For [APV course project assigment](http://odinuv.cz/course/#project-assignment) 
I have chosen to add features to this project
 that were taught in the course, but I haven't used them:
- paginate result list
- input client and server side validation
- user login, authorization - user and role models
- database tables with relations:
    - display data from app.Libtech3 models
    - Player model
    - M-N relation of Player and app.Libtech3.Demo
- error logging
